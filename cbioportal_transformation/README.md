# Transform PMC data to cBioPortal staging files

This code runs as part of the Luigi Pipeline. To manually test and debug this code, run it with the following arguments:
```
./pmc_cbio_wrapper.py \
  -c ../test_data/intermediate/csr_transformation_data.tsv \
  -n ../test_data/dropzone/NGS/ \
  -o ../test_data/intermediate/cbioportal_staging_files \
  -d ../config/cbioportal_header_descriptions.json
```
